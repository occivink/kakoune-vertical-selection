# kakoune-vertical-selections

[kakoune](http://kakoune.org) plugin to copy the current selection up and downwards to all lines matching the current selection.

[![demo](https://asciinema.org/a/138331.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/138331)

## Setup

Add `vertical-selection.kak` to your autoload directory,`~/.config/kak/autoload`, or source it manually.

## Usage

The script defines three commands: `select-down`, `select-up` and `select-vertically`. They respectively select all lines directly below, above and both that contain the current selection at the same position.
Calling any of the commands with a multi-line selection is undefined behavior.


I suggest the following mappings:
```
map global user v :select-down<ret>
map global user <a-v> :select-up<ret>
map global user V :select-vertically<ret>
```

## Trivia

This was suggested as a primitive by @rouanth on 2017-01-19
([#1115](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1115))
and was followed by an implementation by patching the kakoune source code
([#1116](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/pull/1116)).
The suggested keybinding in the patch was `^`.

* [#1115](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1115): Binding to copy selections vertically to equal substrings
* [#1116](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/pull/1116): Keybinding for copying selections on matching substrings vertically
